I am Marco Luzzara, a developer with a passion for automation and optimization. I love understanding how things work, not just making them work.

After primary school, I attended *Liceo Scientifico Belfiore* in Mantova, where I first discovered programming. My journey began with Pascal, but I quickly transitioned to C/C++. During those five years, I also developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, which I continued to cultivate for a few years afterwards. My final project in high school focused on phishing and the most effective techniques for detecting it.

In 2016, I moved to Trento to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It was my first experience living away from home, but since Trento is a small city like Mantova, I adapted quickly. During my studies, I began working with Aliaslab S.p.A., an IT company based in Mantova, under an intermittent contract. It was an incredible experience, mostly thanks to the team, who taught a 19 years old how to work efficiently in a collaborative environment. My Bachelor‚Äôs thesis focused on CI/CD, with a practical case study based on my projects at Aliaslab S.p.A.

While in Trento, I also deepened my love for cycling: the surrounding hills made every ride both challenging and thrilling.

I completed my studies in early 2020 and began my Master's degree in Milan the same year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of my courses were online. Around that time, I paused my collaboration with Aliaslab S.p.A. to focus on university, but soon missed the hands-on experience of the industry. I then joined AddValue S.r.l. in Verona for a six-month internship, where I gained significant experience with the AWS ecosystem. My Master's thesis was based on this internship, marking the completion of my academic journey.

Since this page is titled *"About Me"* I cannot skip two other important parts of my life:

- **Sports**: I have been playing basketball in a team since around 2014. I enjoy all kinds of sports: volleyball, tennis, table tennis, and trekking among them.
- **Board games**: I especially love strategic board games, though the shorter (under one hour) ones can be just as fun üòÅ.
