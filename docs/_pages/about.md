Hello, I am Marco Luzzara, a developer that loves to automate and optimize things. I obtained the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in the University of Trento and the Master's degree in Computer Science in the University of Milan (UNIMI), where I am currently working as a researcher. For an in-depth look into my career, please visit the [Resume page](/resume).

I have always found hard to categorize myself strictly as a Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer, Software Testing Engineer, or any other specific role. Over the years, I have explored a wide range of topics, and I am sure this attitude will continue in the future. Up to now, the single thing I have constantly avoided is building websites, like this one (Thanks [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for letting me write my website using Markdown).

I firmly believe in the Open Source world, which is why every project I start is publicly available on [my Github profile]({{ site.author.links[2].url }}). When I tackle challenging problems, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights on Stack Overflow. You can find my contributions on [my SO profile]({{ site.author.links[3].url }})

I play in an amateur basketball team in Mantova, but I like lot of other sports, such as table tennis and volleyball. I also love playing board games, especially strategic ones.
